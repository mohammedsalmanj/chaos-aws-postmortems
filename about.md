💡 Analogy

Easy metaphor — like explaining to a new SRE intern or business leader:

EC2 disk fill → “like your phone running out of storage”

Aurora reboot → “like restarting your bank’s database server mid-day”

DNS outage → “like the phonebook losing everyone’s contact numbers”

EKS pod delete → “like removing a cashier but another one automatically replaces them”

Fargate stress → “like overloading a machine until it slows down and self-recovers”

AZ shutdown → “like one branch of a company closing and others taking its calls”
